# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** Accurate 3D fish midline reconstruction from multi-view silhouettes via refractive multi-view triangulation
**Current focus:** v3.7 Improved Tracking — Phase 78.1 (OBB & Pose Production Retrain)

## Current Position

Phase: 78.1 of v3.7 (OBB & Pose Production Retrain)
Plan: — (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-10 — Phase 78 complete (GO), Phase 79 skipped, Phase 78.1 inserted

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: ~10min
- Total execution time: ~20min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 78 | 2 | ~20min | ~10min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
v3.6 milestone decisions archived to milestones/v3.6-ROADMAP.md.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- [v3.7 seed]: KF state dimension (60-dim vs 24-dim) to be resolved during Phase 83 planning
- [v3.7 seed]: BoxMot dependency removal decision deferred to Phase 85
- [v3.7 seed]: TRACK-10 (BYTE-style secondary pass) conditional on INV-04 findings in Phase 78
- [Phase 78]: GO recommendation — no keypoint identity jumps, no OBB merging during occlusion
- [Phase 78]: Phase 79 (Occlusion Remediation) skipped per GO decision
- [Phase 78]: Confidence threshold can drop to 0.1 with polygon NMS
- [Phase 78]: White-wall detection dropout identified — Phase 78.1 inserted for production retrain
- [Phase 78]: Multi-instance pose output is Gaussian NMS artifact, not cross-fish detection

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 78.1 inserted after Phase 78: OBB & Pose Production Retrain (URGENT) — detection dropout on white-wall background persists after pseudo-label round; retrain with corrected pseudo-labels in train/val split and more epochs

### Pending Todos

10 pending todos -- see .planning/todos/pending/ (review for relevance)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Algae domain shift between manual annotations (clean tank) and current conditions may cause false positives in pseudo-labels
- Phase 79 skipped (GO decision); Phase 86 conditional on Phase 85 findings
