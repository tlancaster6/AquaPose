# 02.1-03 Summary: Mask R-CNN Training via Label Studio (SKIPPED)

## Decision

This plan was **skipped** — the Mask R-CNN + Label Studio pipeline was superseded by a lighter approach:

- **SAM2 pseudo-labels** used directly as training data (no Label Studio correction)
- **U-Net** (MobileNetV3-Small encoder, ~2.5M params) replaced Mask R-CNN
- U-Net achieved 0.623 val IoU — accepted to unblock Phase 4

## Rationale

The original plan assumed Label Studio corrections were needed for quality training data. In practice, SAM2 pseudo-labels (with YOLO detection + crop-and-box prompting) were sufficient. The lightweight U-Net trains faster and has lower inference cost than Mask R-CNN, making it a better fit for the multi-camera pipeline.
